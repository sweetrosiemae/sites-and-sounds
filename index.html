            <h2>About Sites + Sounds</h2>
            <p>
                Covid 19 has deeply impacted the once thriving arts community.  Emerging artists have lost many of the galleries in which their work was displayed.  Musicians, dancers and performers have witnessed the closure of their performance spaces and cancellation of their shows.  Many of these platforms will not return after the lockdown is over. These platforms were not simply a place to sell or promote their work.  The galleries and event spaces were home to many artists,  a safe place where they could talk, network and be inspired.  Daily life under lockdown has left so many bereft of human interaction and motivation.

                    <p>
                        Art has a way of shining a light into the deepest, darkest crevices of our beings. It’s a powerful portal that can move us beyond the mind, straight to the truths that dance in our hearts. I love how we can be moved to tears by a painting or suddenly become inspired to make an important change in our lives after listening to a song. Art is healing. Art is everywhere. Art is life.

                    <h3>Artist: Emily Bright</h3>
                    <p>
                        F*ck Covid! Life as we knew it has vanished and people’s dreams have simply gone “poof!” We’re starving for love and connection. It’s heartbreaking. Humanity is at its breaking point, yet we’re all trying to “make the most of it.” This pandemic has been tricky. I’ve been faced with navigating through the death of a parent and caring for the other who is left behind. The rest of my family are stuck abroad feeling helpless. My children’s daily activities that inspire and enrich their lives through leadership, healthy socialization and physical activity, have come to a complete halt. As a teacher, I’ve witnessed my students and their families suffering with sickness, deaths, job losses and family break-ups. Parents are scared for their children’s futures. And I’m doing my best to support them and be a positive force in their lives. So, F*ck Covid!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And then there’s ART. As a portrait artist, my creativity is fueled by people, human interaction, and the hustle & bustle that “used to be” part of daily life. Human connection is my muse. Life♻️Art. They’re inseparable to me. Yet, when life is reduced to virtual zoom calls and social distancing, it feels like my senses are muffled and muted. During this pandemic, I’ve leaned on my art as an escape – it’s the magical “trip” I cannot take. It’s a natural high. My best friend. A return to “self.” It’s the place I find peace, love, comfort, and joy. It allows my heart to speak.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So for now, while human connection feels lost, perhaps life’s simplest pleasures are to be found? Paint. Dance. Build. Write. Sing. Love. Dream. Read. Draw… 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do whatever it takes to keep love alive.

                    The Pandemic has impacted the entire Art scene in Toronto heavily. Galleries not being open, galleries closing completely, shows being virtual and artists not being able to show their work in the manner it deserves, in many cases has left artists without motivation and feeling lost. My own personal practice has always been based around connecting to people and not relying on showing at a gallery to be my main focus. Not how many works I've sold, who I've shown with or a persona I'm seen as. I've always let my work speak for itself to whoever it needs to however it needs to. I needed to figure out how to reach the people in my city directly during their time in need. So they knew they weren't the only ones feeling the way they do. To let them know they weren't  alone. So I took to the streets to speak on personal and social issues going on. I put my work out into the world where it was free to everyone who needed it. I wanted to show my work in the only  environment people were allowed to be in. I wanted it to be free and I wanted it to send out the vibrations of hope.
